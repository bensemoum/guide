    <h1>Creating Secret Phones </h1>
    <p>You can collect four phones that are already hidden in this game, and there is a way to make you a secret phone too. That is what we will talk about as the second thing in this Toca Life Word tips list. Players can take help from Nari, Leon, Zeke and Rita for collecting these phones, and all the ingredients you need will be placed in the Bob city. </p>

    <p>Players need to visit Rita’s apartment and then collect the blue joystick to give to Zeke. You need to do this without making it to the hero’s bottom panel, and this joystick can be placed at any place with your movements. So you need to memorize where you have put it. Then you need to go to the theatre to the dressing room and collect the green gem. Green gem has to be passed to Rita and find another thermal bag from the garage. </p>
    <p>TThere will be a backroom placed exactly next to the garage, and there you can take the Toca Boca image. Then players will have all the ingredients they want for making phones. And then you need to go outside and put all your items in the bag. And players need to make sure to expose all their heroes through a character panel. After this manipulation, you will be placed with four phones. </p>
