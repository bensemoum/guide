    <p>While many people think of fantasy cricket apps as a paid competition, there are free contests on My11Circle that you can join without using any money. </p>
    <p>The practice contests that we talked about earlier are free to join and can be played by anyone. </p>
    <h3>Here’s how you can play My11Circle for free: </h3>
    <p>1. Open the app and select a match you want to play.</p>
    <p>2. Click on the “practice” button on the top. </p>
    <p>3. Join the first league. These are free to join competitions and do not require any payment. However, these contests will also not provide you any cash prize in case you win. </p>
    <p>4. Create your My11Circle team and play for free! </p>
