            "part2" : "A VPN will provide you with an anonymous connection to the Internet. This will prevent IPTV developers, Internet provider, government agencies, and any 3rd party from logging what you're accessing online. The most popular VPN among cord-cutters is Surfshark due to their blazing fast speeds and zero log policy. It's important to use a VPN that is fast since we are streaming large HD files. Its also crucial to find one that keeps no logs of what their subscribers access while online. Setting up Surfshark on your streaming device is simple! Step 1 Register for an Surfshark VPN account by clicking the link below. \n Step 2 - Go to Find and then click the search icon on your Firestick, Fire TV, or Fire TV Cube. You may also find the Surfshark VPN App in the Google Play Store for those of you who are using Android TV Boxes, phones, and tablets. \n Step 3 - Type Surfshark and then click the Surfshark VPN option that appears. \n Step 4 - Click the Surfshark icon under Apps & Games. \n Step 5 - Click Download. \n Step 6 - Click Open. \n Step 7 - Click Log in. \n Step 8 - Enter your username and password to login. Your username is the email that you used to register for Surfshark service with and your password is automatically generated and emailed to you. \n Step 9 – Click the Fastest location option. \n Step 10 – Click OK for Connection request if it appears. \n Step 11 – You will notice that your IP Address changes along with location of connection. You are now operating anonymously through your device. \n Click the Home Button on your remote and the VPN will remain running in the background. Congratulations! You are now protected by Surfshark VPN which means everything that you stream or access through your Firestick or Android TV Box is hidden from the rest of the world. If you ever need to stop the VPN service, simply re-launch the application and click the DISCONNECT button. "
