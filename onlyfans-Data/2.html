    <p>OnlyFans is pretty competitive in 2022. What happened in 2020-2021 has led to a huge influx of onlyfans creators. More creators mean more competition for attention from customers. This is why you need to niche down. </p>
    <p>
      <stronge>NICHE(S) = LESS COMPETITION</stronge>
    </p>
    <p>One of the main benefits of a niche market is less competition. If you’re only targeting the BBW niche then you are only competing with the BBW creators only and not ALL OnlyFans creators. The MORE specific you get with multiple niches the less competition there is. A creator in the BBW and tattoo niche has less competition than a creator in only the BBW niche. </p>
    <p>
      <stronge>NICHE = BRAND LOYALTY</stronge>
    </p>
    <p>Niche marketing helps creators build brand loyalty. You deal with a smaller audience. So, you can focus on the quality of customer interactions and nurture your relationship with them more. All aspects of your content – your clothes, props, the way you talk, the way you type, how playful you act – all should reflect your niche(s). This is effective branding.</p>
