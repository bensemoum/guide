    <h1>How to find the right style of yoga for you </h1>
    <img src="" style="width:100%">
    <p>If you’ve ever browsed yoga class schedules in your area yoga studios, you’ve likely encountered a slew of options—perhaps some with names you don’t recognize or understand. These names typically signify various styles (or types) of yoga, a specific yoga workout, and the different approaches vary in intensity, focus, and format. Here are common styles of yoga you may encounter.*</p>
    <h3>Ashtanga yoga</h3>
    <img src="" style="width:100%">
    <p>The inspiration for many vinyasa-style yoga classes, ashtanga yoga is an athletic and demanding practice based on a set sequence of postures that never changes, with sequences in increasing levels of difficulty. Traditionally, ashtanga—which was founded by K. Pattabhi Jois (1915–2009)—is taught “Mysore style,” meaning students learn a series of poses and practice at their own pace while a teacher moves around the room providing adjustments and personalized suggestions. </p>
    <h3>Hatha yoga</h3>
    <img src="" style="width:100%">
    <p>Most forms of yoga in the West can be classified as hatha yoga. Hatha simply refers to the practice of physical yoga postures, meaning your ashtanga, vinyasa, Iyengar, and Power Yoga classes are all hatha Yoga. The word “hatha” can be translated two ways: as “willful” or “forceful” (or the yoga of activity) and as “sun” (ha) and “moon” (that) meaning the yoga of balance. Hatha practices are designed to align and calm your body, mind, and spirit in preparation for meditation, and as such you may hold each pose for several breaths at a time and move slowly between postures.</p>
    <h3>Hot yoga</h3>
    <img src="" style="width:100%">
    <p>Any style of yoga practiced in an intentionally heated room is hot yoga. This would include Forrest Yoga and CorePower Yoga. In these classes, the studio is set to temperatures ranging from 85 degrees to 105 degrees Fahrenheit. The heat is said to help you sweat out toxins while you work toward increased strength and flexibility—it’s important to exert caution and not overstretch or hyperextend your joints while practicing. Here are some other tips for staying safe in hot yoga. </p>
    <h3>Iyengar Yoga</h3>
    <img src="" style="width:100%">
    <p>By paying close attention to anatomical details and the alignment of each posture, Iyengar Yoga is the practice of precision. Poses are held for long periods and often modified with props. This method—founded by B.K.S. Iyengar—is designed to systematically cultivate strength, flexibility, stability, and awareness, and can be therapeutic for specific conditions. </p>
    <h3>Jivamukti</h3>
    <img src="" style="width:100%">
    <p>Incorporating chanting, meditation, pranayama, philosophy, and music into a vigorous flowing asana, or vinyasa practice, Jivamukti is a physically and intellectually stimulating type of yoga. This system emphasizes bringing ancient teachings alive in a contemporary setting, and espouses environmental sustainability, veganism, and other values. Jivamukti was founded by David Life and Sharon Gannon in 1984 in New York City. Since then, it has expanded to multiple studios around the world, although the famed NYC studio and school closed in 2019. </p>
    <h3>Kundalini Yoga</h3>
    <img src="" style="width:100%">
    <p>An uplifting blend of spiritual and physical practices, Kundalini Yoga incorporates movement, dynamic breathing techniques, meditation, and the chanting of mantras, such as Sat Nam, meaning “truth is my identity,” with the goal of building physical vitality and increasing consciousness. Kundalini Yoga was brought to the West by Yogi Bhajan (Harbhajan Singh Khalsa) in 1969. Practitioners of Kundalini Yoga often wear white—Bhajan believed the color helped extend your aura—and head coverings, which is thought to focus your energy at your third eye (ajna) chakra.</p>
    <h3>Power Yoga</h3>
    <img src="" style="width:100%">
    <p>Power Yoga is a fitness-based vinyasa practice. An offshoot of ashtanga, it has many of the same qualities and benefits, including building internal heat, increasing stamina, strength, and flexibility, as well as stress reduction. Teachers design their own sequences, while students synchronize their breath with their movement. The original Power Yoga was developed and founded by Beryl Bender Birch, but it is now a term used to describe many vigorous vinyasa styles. </p>
    <h3>Prenatal yoga</h3>
    <img src="" style="width:100%">
    <p>A practice uniquely designed for pregnancy, prenatal yoga can help support moms-to-be emotionally and physically. With an emphasis on breathing, stamina, pelvic floor work, restorative poses, and core strength, Prenatal Yoga can help you become more resilient during and after pregnancy. </p>
    <h3>Restorative yoga</h3>
    <img src="" style="width:100%">
    <p>A restorative yoga class typically involves only five or six poses, supported by props—like blankets, bolsters, or pillows, and blocks or stacks of books—that allow you to completely relax and rest. Held for 5 minutes or more, restorative poses include light twists, seated forward folds, and gentle backbends. Most restorative practices are based on the teachings of B.K.S. Iyengar. </p>
    <h3>Tantra Yoga</h3>
    <img src="" style="width:100%">
    <p>While most of us think of sex when we think of Tantra Yoga, this ancient practice is actually a powerful combination of asana, mantra, mudra, bandha (energy lock), and chakra (energy center) work that you can use to build strength, clarity, and bliss in everyday life. By harnessing and embodying the five forces of Shakti, the female deity that represents creativity and change, Tantric Yoga suggests we can move through the world with more confidence and contentment. </p>
    <h3>Vinyasa</h3>
    <img src="" style="width:100%">
    <p>The word vinyasa can be translated as “arranging something in a special way,” like yoga poses, for example. In vinyasa yoga classes, students coordinate movement with breath to flow from one pose to the next. Ashtanga, Power Yoga, and prana flow could all be considered vinyasa yoga. Vinyasa classes typically comprise a sequence of poses (for example, Chaturanga to Upward-Facing Dog to Downward-Facing Dog) that are ordered to gradually intensify the stretching of the body. </p>
    <h3>Yin Yoga</h3>
    <img src="" style="width:100%">
    <p>This practice, which was originally introduced in the 1970s, is designed to stretch the connective tissue, especially around your joints (mainly the knees, pelvis, sacrum, and spine). A largely passive practice, Yin Yoga involves variations of seated and supine poses that are typically held for 3 to 5 minutes to access deeper layers of fascia. The benefits of Yin Yoga include increased flexibility during the practice of other styles of yoga as well as in everyday life. </p>
    <h3>Yoga Therapy</h3>
    <img src="" style="width:100%">
    <p>Any yogic technique used to systematically address physical injury or pain, or mental and emotional stress or trauma, can be considered yoga therapy. There are different approaches to yoga therapy, including Viniyoga, Integrative Yoga Therapy, Phoenix Rising Yoga, and iRest yoga. Note that the teachers are frequently not licensed therapists. </p>
    <p>*Yoga is not without its scandals and controversies. Some prominent teachers associated with several of these styles of yoga have been accused of sexual assault, harassment, and other improper conduct. While these instances are important to be aware of, the behavior of individuals is not reflective of the practice of yoga as a whole. </p>
