    <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JCuvvsZLyBk/XpmHywuFugI/AAAAAAAABNY/zXsj0UkawmUltyQQLDlnKCEE2XQL7ln5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/My11circle%2B1.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <p>My11Circle is a pretty easy app that allows you to pick players you think will perform best in a live match and build your virtual playing 11. </p>
    <p>Once the match starts, you gather points based on the player’s actual performance during the match. </p>
    <p>The user with the most points at the end of the match wins the competition. </p>
    <p>If you play a cash contest (with real money), it goes into a common pool, and each player gets paid based on their ranks. My 11 Circle charges a service fee from every cash contest.</p>
    <p>The core of My 11 Circle can be summed in 3 simple steps: </P> 1. Select a Match <br />
    <h>2. Create your My11Circle Team <br /> 3. Join Free & Cash Contests to win <br />
      <h1>1. Select a Match</h1>

      <p>Once you have installed the My 11 Circle app and have made an account, you will be presented with a list of upcoming matches. You can choose any upcoming match of your choice and start creating your Fantasy 11 team.</p>
      <h1>2. Create your My 11 Circle Team</h1>
      <img src="https://weknowcricket.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot_2021-01-09-00-37-55-698_com.my11circle.android-1-602x1024.jpg" style="width:100%">
      <p>Once you have selected the match you want to play, it’s time to pick a playing 11 from the two teams.</p>
      <p>My 11 Circle provides you with a budget of 100 credits (virtual money) to “buy players for your fantasy team.</p>
      <p>You have to make sure to make your team with these 100 credits. Note that you can only pick a maximum of 7 players from one team.</p>
      <p>Once you have selected 11 players, on the next screen, you will be prompted to select a Captain and a Vice-Captain of your My11Circle team.</p>
      <p>Make sure you pick your captain and vice-captain wisely as the Captain will receive double points (2X) and the Vice-Captain will receive 1.5 X points scored in every match. </p>
      <p>Note: You can make any last-minute changes after the toss and can also change the Captain or Vice-Captain before the deadline of the match (before the first ball is bowled in the live match). </p>
      <h1>3. Join a Contest</h1>

      <p>Once done creating your team, you can join three types of contests- cash, free, or private contests depending upon your budget.</p>
      <p>Note that every cash contest requires an entry-fee to join and play upfront. The prize breakdown for each contest is stated clearly and you can join depending upon your confidence and skill level.</p>
      <h1>4. Follow the Match</h1>
