If successfully executed, these attacks can do a considerable amount of damage on your opponent. However, they can be escaped, blocked, or counter-attacked (i.e.while your in a 10- hitter, your opponent might be able to perform a throw move on you) Variations can be performed on the attack strings, yet you must follow the notated moves in this faq to achieve the full 10 hits. These attacks are impressive to witness and hard to block if part of the string connects as moves very from high to low attacks. \n \n Unblockable Attacks: \n \n These attacks generally take a while to execute, which allows your opponent to knock you out of it's execution. If they do connect, these attacks cannot be blocked and do considerable damage. The amount of damage is variable when your playing in the 2-player mode where handicaps can be adjusted. \n  \n Hard Pounces: \n \n Normally to execute a pounce attack, you just hit U + RP when your opponent is on the ground. This causes you to automatically jump into the air and land on your opponent with a pounce attack that is usually different from your character's regular ground punch while jumping. When normal pounces tend to 'home in'  on the opponent to some extent, heavy pounces have a set range, which is rather short, so you must aim correctly if you want to hit the them. Also, hard pounces can be done any time, even if they're not on the ground. If you do a hard pounce while your opponent is just standing there, expect to get hit. Hard pounces are also slower than normal pounces, so your opponent has more time to recover before you hit, and there is a greater lag time for you after doing a heavy pounce, giving your opponent more time to retaliate. \n ",
            "part2" : "Throws: \n \n As most games, all throws must be performed at a very close range. Many people have accused Tekken of being cheap because so many throw type moves are included in the game. I feel that this makes for much more strategic game play and although every player has two basic throw moves (LP/LK, RP/RK), the more elaberate throws are harder to pull off in the heat of battle against good players. It's very easy to see if someone's trying to pull a throw on you, most characters 	will be attempting to 'grab' at the air. It's very easy to hit or counter- throw them at this point when their unsuccessful grab is relaxing and pulling back to their body. Executing a throw move while your opponent is performing a jumping attack will cause them to be 'bounced' back onto the ground unhurt, with their jumping attack and your throw attack unsuccessful (damage-wise)."
