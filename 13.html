    </p>
    <h2>Game Changers</h2>
    <p>If not with the ball, <strong>Samit Patel</strong> offers points with the bat. He was promoted to No.4 in Trent’s last game, and he replied with a knock of 21 off 15 including two sixes. His eight wickets are the second-most for his team. </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dwaine Pretorius</strong>’ entry in the 100 League has reaped benefits for the fantasy players in all departments. He has hunted down four wickets. His scores down the order read 4*, 29, 15, and 23. And in the field, he has grabbed three catches.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Daniel Sams</strong>’ numbers, however, read slightly better in the business of all-rounders: six wickets, the highest score of 55*, and three catches.
    </p>
    <h2>Smart Fantasy Picks</h2>
    <p>In the list of wicketkeepers, <strong>Tom Kohler-Cadmore</strong> has outperformed his namesake Banton. Kohler-Cadmore has top scores of 41 and 30, and with the gloves, he has inflicted one stumping and taken three catches. </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Luke Wood</strong> has scalped the bulk of the wickets for Trent. His nine wickets have come at a strike rate 15 and his best figures read 3 for 17.
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, <strong>Jake Ball</strong> has been the best bowler for Welsh. His best figures read 4 for 29, courtesy his ability to outfox the batters at the death with his variations. </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Colin Munro</strong> has scored a twenty, thirty, and a fifty. He may not have been as consistent as he is expected to, but he has been getting good starts and hence justifying his selection percentage in fantasy cricket.
    </p>
    <h2>Power Players</h2>
    <p>Amongst both teams, <strong>Dawid Malan</strong> has generated the most fantasy points (210) on My11Circle. With 300 runs at a strike rate of 175, he is the season’s highest run-scorer. He has smashed three fifties and a thirty. </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Alex Hales</strong> is not too far behind, with 181.5 points to his credit. Along with his batting talent (two fifties and two thirties), he has pouched points in the field as well. His five catches are the most by a Trent player.
    </p>
    <p>For Welsh, <strong>Ben Duckett</strong> has been the best performer in fantasy leagues. He has scored 195 runs at an average of 33 and a strike rate of 138. He has also provided additional points for three catches. </p>
