      <h1>Is My11Circle legal?</h1>
      <p>Yes, My11Circle is completely legal and as per the Government rules and regulations. Since My11Circle is a game of “skill” and not a game of “chance“, it is completely legal. </p>

      <p> However, if you are using the app from the state of Assam, Orissa, or Telangana, you are prohibited from playing cash contests on My11Circle from any of these states as the law doesn’t allow users of this state to play cash contests on fantasy apps. </p>
