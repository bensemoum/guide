    <p>As it turns out, the factory’s toys are suddenly alive and actively seeking to cause harm. The designer included additional VHS videos for playback throughout the facility to offer a more thorough description of Poppy Playtime’s narrative. </p>
    <p>Some challenges in the game will require the use of a gadget known as a GrabPack; a bag with two extended hands that may be used to grab things that are far away, pull yourself up, swing, and more. Originally, Chapter 1 cost $2.99. However, since the release of Chapter 2, the devs decided to give the first installment for free. </p>
