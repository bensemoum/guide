    <h1>Poppy Playtime Chapter 3 </h1>
    <p>As far as we know, Poppy Playtime Chapter 3 will be released in 2023. However, we don’t yet know the specific date, although it’s expected to be early 2023. Even if all goes according to plan, fans should always be prepared for delays. Especially because of MOB Games Studio’s plans to make a movie adaptation of their popular game. </p>
    <p>An upcoming film based on Poppy Playtime is expected to be produced by MOB Games in partnership with Studio71. Their goal is to develop an imaginative narrative with the help of American film producer Roy Lee. </p>
