    <p>That being said, there is also no dedicated application to run JioTV on your desktop or PC. In order to do that, you need to first download an Android Emulator and only then you can use the application. In this article, we are going to tell you about Bluestacks. Hereâ€™s how you can download and view the JioTV application on your Windows 10-powered laptop or PC:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to bluestacks.com and download the Android emulator. Alternatively, you can click on this link.</li>
      <li>Now download and install the emulator on your PC. Once done, you need to sign up using your Google account.</li>
      <li>Just go to Google Play Store and search for the JioTV application.</li>
      <li>Download and install the application on Bluestacks and open it. Just enter the Jio mobile number along with the OTP to start using the app right on your Windows 10 PC or laptop.</li>
    </ol>
