    <p>Reliance Jio TV application is probably the one-stop for all your entertainment needs. The streaming application from the company provides you with a plethora of Live TV channels, which has partially removed the need to buy a DTH connection. The best thing about the app is that it is absolutely free for Reliance Jio customers. However, the only downside of this app is that it only works on Android smartphones or tablets along with the Jio set-up box. That being said, the company has not released a dedicated application for Smart TVs or for PC and laptops. But that does not mean that you cannot watch all the content of Jio TV on your TV or laptop. In this article, we are going to provide a step-by-step guide on how to download and install the Jio TV application on your Smart TV and PC and watch all the Live TV channels for free.</p>
