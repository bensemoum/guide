    <p>For those who are not aware, the Reliance Jio TV application is not available on Android TV. However, this does not mean that you cannot run the application on your Smart TV. We have figured out a workaround through which you can easily stream all the content of Jio TV on your Smart TV. All you need to do is follow these instructions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to your Play Store on Android TV and search for the Kodi application.</li>
      <li>Download and install the application on your Smart TV.</li>
      <li>Now, open the application and go to Settings. There you need to go File Manager and need to click on Add Source.</li>
      <li>In the Add Source option, you need to type https://kodi.botallen.com as a path and name it as BotAllen.</li>
      <li>Once done, you then need to go to Add-ons in the Settings menu and click on Install from Zip File.</li>
      <li>There you need to select BotAllen and then click on repository.botallen zip file.</li>
      <li>Once it is done, you need to go to Add-ons and click on Install from the repository. Select BotAllen Repository and click on Video Add-ons and then go to JioTV.</li>
      <li>The repository will install the application in the Kodi app. Once it is done, you will see an option of Configure when you launch JioTV in Kodi app.</li>
      <li>There you need to go on Configure and then go to PVR Client. Download the client from the list.</li>
      <li>Once done, you then need to go on the Login option in Configure and select keyboard and then OTP. Now, simply enter the Jio mobile number and OTP, which will be sent to your registered mobile number.</li>
      <li>You can now simply open the application and start watching Live TV on your Smart TV with Jio TV application.</li>
    </ol>
