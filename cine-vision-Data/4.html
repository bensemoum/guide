    <p>Most cord-cutters use a VPN and rightfully so. Some IPTV services and app developers have been tied to organized crime and you don't want your identifying IP Address in their hands. Without a VPN, your IP Address is being logged. Your IP Address points back to your location and identity which compromises both your privacy and security.</p>
    <p>A VPN will provide you with an anonymous connection to the Internet. This will prevent IPTV developers, Internet provider, government agencies, and any 3rd party from logging what you're accessing online. The most popular VPN among cord-cutters is Surfshark due to their blazing fast speeds and zero log policy. It's important to use a VPN that is fast since we are streaming large HD files. Its also crucial to find one that keeps no logs of what their subscribers access while online. Setting up Surfshark on your streaming device is simple! Step 1 Register for an Surfshark VPN account by clicking the link below.</p>
