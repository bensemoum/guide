      <h1>What is My 11 Circle?</h1>
      <p>My 11 Circle is a fantasy sports app founded by New York University alumni Trivikraman Thampy and Bhavin Pandya in January 2019. </p>
      <p>The app is part of their company Play Games24x7 which has been in operation since 2006. PlayGames 24×7 is famous for India’s leading rummy app called RummyCircle and has over 10 million registered users.</p>

      <p>My11Circle has quickly gained popularity amongst fantasy players, thanks to its partnership with the one and only Saurav Ganguly. </p>
      <p>Thanks to a ton of advertisements during the IPL season last year, the platform has gained over 1.3 Crore users in such a short span of time.</p>
      <p>Even though My11Circle started off their journey with only cricket, fantasy players can also play fantasy football competitions on the app. </P>
