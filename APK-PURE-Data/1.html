    <p>For several reasons, many excellent apps do not pass through the Google Play filter. Fortunately, there are other alternatives to Play Store and that’s the case of the APKPure, a great App Store to install on your device, where you’ll surely find the apps you are looking for. </p>
    <p>Google offers a lot of apps that you can easily install from the Play Store app, which is usually pre-installed on almost all Android devices. However, the tech giant imposes a lot of restrictions on developers – from the size of the app to copyright issues – which leads to the exclusion of hundreds of apps. This has led to the emergence of very many Play Store alternatives, and APKPure App Store is currently leading the race. </p>
    <p>APKPure is a popular app repository, and they have recently released an Android app that works more like Play Store. The Android store contains almost all apps that can be found on Play Store and others that are not available. It has become a heaven for Android users since you can download all sorts of APKs and XAPKs as you don’t have to worry about geo-restrictions any more. APKPure apps are safe for use, and they have to pass a signature verification check before they are listed in the store. </p>
