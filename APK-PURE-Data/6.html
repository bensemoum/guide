    <h1>How to Install APKPure App Store on Android TV Box</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>To install APKPure on your Android TV box, you need to follow the same steps as Android smartphones</strong>. This is because <strong> File Explorer doesn’t have the browser capability that is needed to download APKPure</strong> from the official site.
    </p>
    <p>For this task, <strong>you need to use the Google Chrome Browser</strong>. You can <strong>get it from the Play Store</strong>. From there, navigate to www.apkpure.com </a> and install the app. You can then install any app you need from there. </p>
    <p>If you haven’t installed IPVanish yet, here’s how you can easily install the VPN:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>
          </a>
        </strong> Create an account at a <strong>IPvanish.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>On the Firestick <strong>search </strong>box, <strong>type IPVanish. </strong>For Android Box, search on <strong>Play Store</strong>
      </li>
      <li>The app will appear as the <strong>first suggestion</strong>. <strong>Click on it</strong>
      </li>
      <li>You will be given the <strong>“Get”</strong> Hit it </li>
      <li>IPVanish will now start downloading</li>
      <li>Launch it and sign in with your credentials.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>After that, you can connect to a server and enjoy your apps safely and without limitations!</p>
