    <h1>The APKPure Android App (Features) </h1>
    <p>Apart from its huge repository of apps, one of the biggest strengths of the APK Pure App Store is its compatibility with the Google Play Store. The app can update apps that have been installed from Play Store and vice versa. To let it update apps automatically, remember to enable “auto-install.” You can also do this from Settings under Accessibility.</p>

    <p>Apart from Store and App Management, APKPure also gives the latest news about popular apps, and there’s also a community where you can interact with developers and other users. </p>
